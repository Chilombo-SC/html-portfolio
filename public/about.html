<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Samson Chilombo, and I'm a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating dynamic and 
  user-friendly web applications. Recently, I completed <b>The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</b> by <b>Angela Yu</b> on 
  Udemy, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and more.</p>

  <p> During the course, I built several projects that showcase my ability to turn creative ideas into fully functional 
  websites and applications. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in web 
  development to ensure my projects are modern, efficient, and effective.</p> 

  <p>In addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a collaborative spirit to 
  every project. I enjoy solving complex problems and am always looking for new challenges that push me to grow as a 
  developer.</p>

  <p>I'm excited to connect with other professionals in the field, contribute to interesting projects, and make a 
  meaningful impact through technology.</p>

  <p>Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or if you have any questions about my work. Let's build something 
  amazing together!</p>
